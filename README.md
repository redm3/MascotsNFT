# MascotsNFT

This contract defines a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain called "Mascots NFT". It uses the ERC721A standard and the OpenZeppelin library to implement functions for minting, buying, and selling the tokens. The contract has several rules and restrictions, such as maximum supply and sale prices, that govern how the tokens can be minted and traded. It also includes a "callerIsUser" modifier to prevent contract callers from executing certain functions.
